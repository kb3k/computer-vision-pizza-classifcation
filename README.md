# computer-vision-pizza-classifcation

**Description:**

This repository contains a prototype that uses a combination of computer vision and natural language processing to classify pizzas. It leverages several powerful tools, including **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **LLaVA**, and **OpenAI**. The goal is to demonstrate how these technologies can work together for pertinent pizza classification purposes.

**Key Technologies Used:**
*   **LangChain**: A framework for developing applications powered by language models.
*   **LlamaIndex**: A data framework for building applications with LLMs
*   **LLaVA**: A large multimodal model that combines vision and language.
*  **OpenAI**: Provides access to powerful language models that can be used in the pipeline.

**Purpose**
This prototype aims to showcase how computer vision and natural language can be used together for specific tasks, in this case, pizza classification. The combination of these methods is intended to provide more accurate and detailed analysis.
